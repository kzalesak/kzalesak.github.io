			<h1>The Grand Voyage</h1>
			<section id="voyage-description">
				<p>You have decided to join us for a part of our grand voyage from Kensal Town to Victoria Park, where we will moor our boat and meet the legendary Justin Crowe, and ask him for his expert assistance to help us install a heater (that is, a lovely wood stove!).</p>
				<p>We will be operating on a hop-on hop-off basis - just wave at us on the canal and we'll stop to pick you up. There will be a couple of locks, so we're sure your strength will come in handy!</p>
				<p>We will be starting at 51°31'36.624"N 0°12'48.856"W</p>
				<p>In order to reach us, you can look at our location here:</p>
